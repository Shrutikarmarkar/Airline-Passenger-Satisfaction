# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
## Project Details
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict passenger satisfaction levels using supervised learning techniques. By analyzing a diverse dataset containing information about flights, services, and passenger feedback, we aim to build models that can classify whether a passenger is likely to be satisfied or dissatisfied with their travel experience.

### Data
The dataset comprises a wide range of features, including flight-related information, in-flight services, customer service interactions, and passenger feedback. These features serve as the basis for training and evaluating the predictive models.

### Models Explored
Several supervised learning algorithms are employed in this project, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost. The models are trained on a labeled dataset, and their performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results and Insights
Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the factors that significantly influence passenger satisfaction. Additionally, the trained models serve as a predictive tool for airlines to anticipate passenger satisfaction, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall travel experience.

### Technologies Used
* Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
